### Some stuff to do
The North Beach Area is close to downtown to the Northwest. Coming from some Hotel like the Omni - There are a few things to see... 

If you walk up Montgomery Street towards Columbus street you'll hit the 5 way intersection there. There is a <a href="https://www.scientology-sanfrancisco.org/" target="_blank">Church of Scientology</a> on the corner where the two streets split, feel free to stop in and donate. 

Need a burger - Checkout <a href="https://columbusburger.com/" target="_blank">Columbus Burgers</a> as you march up Columbus Ave. The area just past this is where the Beat Generation got going. 

Keep following Columbus street up the hill on the left hand side is <a href="https://vesuvio.com/" target="_blank">Vesuvio Cafe</a>, where Jack Kerouc once drank, and the street to the left is Jack Kerouc Alley. 

Keep on going and you'll run into <a href="https://citylights.com/">City Lights</a> - opened in 1953 this is another Beat landmark. Crossing the intersection (both Columbts and Broadway) you will run into the <a href="https://www.kerouac.com/" target="_blank">Beat Museum</a>.

If you skipped the burger, and want Pizza, the renowned <a href="https://tonyspizzanapoletana.com/" target="_blank">Tony's Pizza Napoletana</a>, run by 13-time World Pizza Champion Tony Gemignani. Like Vesuvio Cafe, it features a full bar also, in case you need another drink walking up the hill.

The remaining street and one block to the West is filled with Italian Restaurants.

### Getting there without walking
Buses run up and down Columbus street every 10 mins or less, so it's not a problem. But say you were staying at the Omni. You'd have to go over to Kearny street to catch the bus going up, because Kearny and Montgomery street are running in opposite directions. Go to the GenInfo page here, and check out the sites for the SF Muni and Clipper Cards.
