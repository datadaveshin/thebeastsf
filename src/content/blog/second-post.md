## Background
So yes, the Financial Disctrict is where prior to Covid, that most of the Tech workers worked before companies figured out it was cheaper to not pay rent and let their developers work from home. I guess things were more "financial" prior to that. That said, I worked at a tech company for a short period in the middle of it. Even back then, while crowded, it tended to clear out after about 7-8pm, after all the tech workers left. Basically, people would run out and either grab dinner or a drink or two - never much more than that, and then scoot home. Now, it's really quiet now that the giant buildings aren't full of tech workers. This is the area where a lot of things closed because of it. The rest of the city is pretty much "open", because people actually live there.

The main street here is Market Street. The Bart runs underneath it two levels under the ground.

### Bars and Food

The <a href="https://tadichgrillsf.com/" target="_blank">Tadich Grill</a> is supposedly real good, haven't been there yet, runs $50-100.
